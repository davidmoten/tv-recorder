Sergeant Lewis (Kevin Whately) is a plain family man, he follows orders, and the thing that keeps him from advancing in the Force is that he is a little slow. 

The show takes place in and around Oxford, where many a mysterious murder occurs.

<title>Inglourious Basterds</title><desc>Oscar nominee Brad Pitt stars as the leader of a small group of soldiers assigned to infiltrate occupied France during World War II and engage in targeted acts of retribution against Nazi officers. In the first year of the German occupation of France, Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) witnesses the execution of her family at the hand of Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Shosanna narrowly escapes and flees to Paris where she forges a new identity as the owner and operator of a cinema. Elsewhere in Europe, Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt) organises a group of Jewish American soldiers to perform swift, shocking acts of retribution. Later known to their enemy as "the basterds," Raine's squad joins German actress and undercover agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) on a mission to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Fates converge under a cinema marquis, where Shosanna is poised to carry out a revenge plan of her own. Oscar-winning director Quentin Tarantino's hyper-violent, hyper-stylised action war epic boasts an all-star cast that includes Mike Myers, Samuel L. Jackson, Maggie Cheung, Cloris Leachman, Eli Roth and B.J. Novak.</desc><credits><director>Quentin Tarantino</director><actor>Brad Pitt</actor><actor>Christoph Waltz</actor><actor>Michael Pressman</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

Follow these swampers through the most important time of their year - the thirty day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a story of the American spirit - the lost art of doing things the right way and the fierce desire to preserve a dying way of life from the encroaching modern world.</desc><date>2014</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.2.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

Follow these swampers through the most important time of their year - the thirty day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a story of the American spirit - the lost art of doing things the right way and the fierce desire to preserve a dying way of life from the encroaching modern world.</desc><date>2014</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.3.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Mudcats</title><sub-title>Boiling Point</sub-title><desc>Along Oklahoma's many rivers, a group of daring men practise a tradition dating back to early pioneer days, catching giant catfish with nothing more than their bare hands. Catfish "noodling"is a way to supplement incomes during the regulated catfish season. The colourful characters who practice it brave snakes, bugs, riptides, and more, reaching into muddy waters, using their fingers as bait for giant fish that weigh up to 30 pounds. This series will celebrate this uniquely all-American tradition while showing the little-known world of Mudcatters.</desc><date>2011</date><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Big Shrimpin'</title><sub-title>Troubled Waters</sub-title><desc>Follow the adventures, trials and tribulations of Dominic "The Dom", owner of a fleet of six shrimp boats in the Gulf of Mexico, and his crew of shrimpers from Alabama. They have 30 days across June and July to make their money by scouring the Gulf, looking for the best territory to drag their heavy funnel-shaped trawl nets over the sea floor like a mule pulling a plow. Shrimping has been part of the Gulf since the 17th century when fisherman used vertical nets up to 600 feet in diameter to scoop up the delicacy. With the invention of the flat bottom "otter trawl"along with motorised engines, the territory and depth of shrimping expanded. Currently the US harvests over half million pounds of shrimp and imports another 200 million pounds a year, more than any other country. The competition is fierce among Dom's boats, each crew working hard to bring in the biggest haul for the biggest payday. Travel with the Shrimpers as they battle each other, the weather and crew from other companies.</desc><date>2011</date><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

During the production, Amy and Leonard remark that Penny's acting is remarkable.

Joe and Tommy are night scouting for a new honey hole, but while they're looking for gators, another paycheck presents itself: the shrimp are running.

<title>Midsomer Murders</title><sub-title>Death in the Slow Lane</sub-title><desc>The villains of Midsomer face a new adversary as Neil Dudgeon steps into John Nettles' shoes in a new series of Midsomer Murders. This much loved detective series enters a new era as DCI John Barnaby, a cousin of the original detective, moves in to fight crime in the beautiful but deadly villages and valleys of Midsomer. Neil Dudgeon makes his debut as John Barnaby in Death in the Slow Lane, alongside established Midsomer Murders sidekick DI Ben Jones, played by Jason Hughes. And in the forthcoming second film Dark Secrets, Barnaby is joined by his wife Sarah, played by Fiona Dolman. Sarah Barnaby is the new head teacher at Causton Comprehensive School. In Death in the Slow Lane new DCI John Barnaby arrives in Midsomer and is bemused by the quaint villages and their quirky residents. But when a local DJ is crushed to death at a traditional girls' boarding school, he soon discovers that murder and deception are never far away. As the death toll rises, could Barnaby's first case also be his last?</desc><credits><actor>John Nettles</actor><actor>Daniel Casey</actor><actor>Jane Wymark</actor><actor>Laura Howard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Mystery and Suspense</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">13.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Who's Been Sleeping In My House</title><sub-title>Peter Pan</sub-title><desc>About 500 kms east of Perth, on the fringe of the Western Desert, sits the outback town of Coolgardie. In the 1890s it exploded into life with the discovery of gold, and became a ghost town almost overnight when the gold dried up. Today only a few of the grand buildings from Coolgardie's heyday survive, and one of them is Peter Pan. Tex and Margaret Moore have a remarkable history with Peter Pan that makes their bond with it particularly strong. They first laid eyes on it in the 1970s when the house was in ruins, but it was love at first sight. They began rebuilding it, a monumental task that took eight years. But what makes Tex and Margaret's renovation story so different is they didn't even own the house. It was in the hands of the Public Trustee, and for years they slaved away at restoring Peter Pan in the hope that one day they could buy it. Eventually they did. Coolgardie's a tough old mining town. A fairytale name is the last thing you'd expect out here. So who named it Peter Pan, and why? Also, despite the house being in ruins, the couple has always wondered about the only furniture to survive the years of ransacking - a set of dining chairs with sinister, demonic heads carved onto their backs. And finally, there's a local legend that a barman once hid in Peter Pan's cellar whilst trying to escape an angry lynch mob from nearby Kalgoorlie. Could it be true?</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Scott and Bailey</title><desc>A thrilling investigative drama exploring the personal and professional lives of two female detectives. Detective Constable Rachel Bailey is 30, down-to-earth, noisy, argumentative and single. She's a hardworking, committed detective. She had been in a relationship with a barrister, Nick, until he left her for the wife she didn't know he had. Meanwhile her colleague, Detective Constable Janet Scott is 40, a diplomat and a thinker, as well as being a wife and mother to two teenage girls. She had very strong reasons for wanting to be a detective - her friend was murdered when they were children and the crime has never been solved. They both work for Manchester Metropolitan Police's prestigious Murder Investigation Team and, despite the obvious differences between them, they have developed a robust friendship. Co-created by award-winning writer Sally Wainwright and ex-Detective Inspector Diane Taylor, formerly of the Major Incident Team at Greater Manchester Police, Scott And Bailey is an honest, powerful and funny crime drama series. In this opening episode, angry at being dumped by married lover Nick, Manchester detective Rachel Bailey joins married colleague Janet Scott to investigate the murder, made to resemble a suicide, of Emel Yilmatz, a pregnant teen age Turkish girl. And Janet is approached by old friend Geoff to reopen a dead case.</desc><credits><actor>Suranne Jones</actor><actor>Lesley Sharp</actor><actor>Amelia Bullmore</actor></credits><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Scrub-a-chug</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen.

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Waving From The Ninky Nonk</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.24.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>Roughing Up The Rookie</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>Charlie and Lola</title><sub-title>I Spy With My Little Eyes</sub-title><desc>Follow the adventures of seven-year-old Charlie and his feisty little sister Lola in this fresh, exuberant, delightfully witty animation based on the award-winning picture books by Lauren Child. Charlie is seven. He is loving, patient, and very bright. His little sister Lola is four going on five. She is small, mischievous and very funny. Together they deal with the numerous dilemmas that every small child encounters - dealing with your first wobbly tooth, staying neat and tidy for your first school photograph, not particularly liking spiders or simply just wishing you were bigger. These little stumbling blocks spiral into a succession of imaginative games, role-play and flights of fancy (normally invented by Charlie) to coax his spirited little sister Lola round to seeing things in a more reasoned way. Eating yucky, sticky mashed potato instantly becomes an expedition to the top of Mount Fuji tasting spoonfuls of cloud fluff. Going to bed is much more fun if it involves drinking pink milk with tigers and shooing whales down the plughole. And tomatoes? Well, they're not really tomatoes. They're Moonsquirters from the land of Moon! Charlie and Lola series two consists of 26x12 minute episodes screening weekdays at 4.05pm from Friday, April 27 on ABC Kids.</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Where Did Makka Pakka's Sponge Go?</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Chilly Chuggers</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.15.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Stunt Brewster</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.16.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen.

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Ninky Nonk Dinner Swap</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>No Tears In Towing</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 10</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition.

Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 11</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.10.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 12</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.11.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition.

Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 2, episode 1</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 2, episode 2</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

<title>Uninhabited</title><desc>Geraldine Hakewill and Henry James star in this Australian horror thriller inspired by a terrifying true story about a young couple holidaying on a deserted island, where they begin to find evidence of an intruder around their retreat, who seems to resent their presence. Adventurous young lovers Harry (Henry James) and Beth (Geraldine Hakewill) excitedly travel to their remote holiday destination, a deserted island which will contain just the two of them for ten days. As they settle in for a romantic sojourn together, everything seems idyllic until several incidents begin to unsettle them. The couple's belongings are rifled through, and they discover a grave adjacent to an abandoned hut, which contains a journal detailing other people's visits to the island, which were affected by the presence of something, or someone, sinister. Finally, Beth and Harry discover footprints that are not theirs. With their fear growing, they see a person standing out on the reef, and attempt to call the island manager to come to collect them, but the menacing presence, who seems determined to get rid of them, has other plans for the two castaways.</desc><credits><director>Bill Bennett</director><actor>Geraldine Hakewill</actor><actor>Henry James</actor></credits><date>2010</date><category>Science Fiction</category><category>Horror</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>The Nefertiti Bust</title><desc>This documentary uncovers the extraordinary story behind one of the ancient worlds most iconic images. The blue-crowned statue of a beautiful woman, wearing the full regalia of a royal wife was officially dug out of the Amarna desert in 1912. Since that time, admirers have marvelled not only at its artistry, but at its remarkable preservation: the fact that something so delicate could have survived, virtually pristine, for three and a half thousand years. This program traces the history of the bust, and the woman behind it. Egyptologists Jacquelyn Williamson and Barry Kemp reveal Queen Nefertiti as the most powerful woman that Egypt had known. They uncover a story of political, cultural and religious revolution.

<title>The Island With Bear Grylls</title><desc>Generations of men have wondered if they could survive on a desert island. This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.

<title>Owl's Odyssey</title><desc>When a female barn-owl's home - an old disused barn - is demolished, she has to seek a new place to live. On the way, flying through forests and across grasslands, she encounters most of the common owl species in Central Europe: long - and short-eared owls, little, tawny and eagle owls, some she can live peacefully beside, others she must shun or risk becoming their prey. During her journey, the film shows how owls fly so silently and hunt so efficiently; it illustrates what they have meant to humans since ancient times, and how they live beside us today. It explains why they have become - unfairly - associated with death. Our owl finally finds a new home, as the guest of a barn owl family, in time to see the new clutch of young following their mother on their first majestic flight.

<title>Made In Italy With Silvia Colloca</title><desc>Silvia Colloca, actress, opera singer and author of hit cookbook Silvias Cucina, serves up an Italy rarely seen by tourists during a culinary celebrazione. In this sumptuous and picturesque new series, Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare. In the first episode, Silvia Colloca travels through Central Italy on a culinary celebration of traditional Italian cuisine. Her breath is taken away by stunning seaside dining on the Adriatic sea, where she learns how to make zuppa di cozze (mussles in white wine broth) on a bygone fishing pier called a Trabocco. Heading inland to her family home in Torricella, Silvia calls upon locally produced white wine to create a superbly simple dish, pollo in potacchio (chicken in a pot).

<title>The Nefertiti Bust</title><desc>This documentary uncovers the extraordinary story behind one of the ancient worlds most iconic images. The blue-crowned statue of a beautiful woman, wearing the full regalia of a royal wife was officially dug out of the Amarna desert in 1912. Since that time, admirers have marvelled not only at its artistry, but at its remarkable preservation: the fact that something so delicate could have survived, virtually pristine, for three and a half thousand years. This program traces the history of the bust, and the woman behind it. Egyptologists Jacquelyn Williamson and Barry Kemp reveal Queen Nefertiti as the most powerful woman that Egypt had known. They uncover a story of political, cultural and religious revolution.

<title>The Island With Bear Grylls</title><desc>Generations of men have wondered if they could survive on a desert island. This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.

<title>Owl's Odyssey</title><desc>When a female barn-owl's home - an old disused barn - is demolished, she has to seek a new place to live. On the way, flying through forests and across grasslands, she encounters most of the common owl species in Central Europe: long - and short-eared owls, little, tawny and eagle owls, some she can live peacefully beside, others she must shun or risk becoming their prey. During her journey, the film shows how owls fly so silently and hunt so efficiently; it illustrates what they have meant to humans since ancient times, and how they live beside us today.

<title>Made In Italy With Silvia Colloca</title><desc>Silvia Colloca, actress, opera singer and author of hit cookbook Silvias Cucina, serves up an Italy rarely seen by tourists during a culinary celebrazione. In this sumptuous and picturesque new series, Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare. In the first episode, Silvia Colloca travels through Central Italy on a culinary celebration of traditional Italian cuisine. Her breath is taken away by stunning seaside dining on the Adriatic sea, where she learns how to make zuppa di cozze (mussles in white wine broth) on a bygone fishing pier called a Trabocco. Heading inland to her family home in Torricella, Silvia calls upon locally produced white wine to create a superbly simple dish, pollo in potacchio (chicken in a pot).

Next up is hot chicken in Nashville, and Michael pushes his personal limit to find out just how spicy he can handle it. And in his hometown of Cleveland, he tackles the mother of all burgers - the brunch burger, topped with massive onion rings and an over easy egg.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Ching's Restaurant Redemption</title><sub-title>Fusion Fire</sub-title><desc>Ching-He Huang's next restaurant seems like a lost cause from the get go. Hidden in a nondescript mall in Pennsylvania with no obvious signage, it's a challenge to find it.

This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.

<title>Bronson</title><desc>"In introducing himself, Michael "Charles Bronson" Peterson (Tom Hardy) tells his audience that he sought fame from an early age, but did not have conventional talents. It is soon apparent that his talent lies in other areas, as he takes on a number of prison guards in a cage fight. Peterson's early life is shown in flashback, as his violent tendencies begin to surface at school. At the age of 19, his robbery of a post office sends him to prison for seven years, where he comes into his psychopathic element. Creating constant havoc by starting fights with prison officers sees Peterson shunted around various prisons and eventually a psychiatric hospital. He is eventually paroled, and starts boxing, taking on the stage name of Charles Bronson. Inevitably, Bronson ends up back in prison, and notches up 30 years in solitary confinement, which only heightens his distorted and evil take on reality, and ensures his infamy instead of fame."</desc><credits><director>Nicolas Winding Refn</director><actor>Tom Hardy</actor><actor>Matt King</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Biography</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

Everyone from 19-year-old Isobel struggling to socialise at university, to 100-year-old Olive, talks with such remarkable honesty and bravery that you can't help but be touched by their stories.</desc><category>Documentary</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Star Trek</title><desc>The greatest adventure of all time begins with a young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the USS Enterprise. In the midst of an incredible journey full of optimism, intrigue, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind. The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals born worlds apart. James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy, a natural-born leader in search of a cause and Spock (Zachary Quinto), reared on the planet Vulcan, an outcast due to his half-human background, which makes him susceptible to the volatile emotions that Vulcans have long lived without, and yet an ingenious, determined student, who will become the first of his kind accepted into the Starfleet Academy. Kirk and Spock could not be more different. Yet, in their quest to figure out who they really are and what they have to give to the world, they soon become competitive cadets. With their drastically opposite styles, one driven by fiery passion, the other by rigorous logic, they also become defiant, contentious adversaries, each equally unimpressed with the other, each going all out to be among the special few chosen to join the crew of the most advanced starship ever created, the USS Enterprise. The all-star cast includes Eric Bana, Simon Pegg, Winona Ryder, Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood and Leonard Nimoy.</desc><credits><director>J.J.

<title>Star Trek</title><desc>The greatest adventure of all time begins with a young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the USS Enterprise. In the midst of an incredible journey full of optimism, intrigue, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind. The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals born worlds apart. James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy, a natural-born leader in search of a cause and Spock (Zachary Quinto), reared on the planet Vulcan, an outcast due to his half-human background, which makes him susceptible to the volatile emotions that Vulcans have long lived without, and yet an ingenious, determined student, who will become the first of his kind accepted into the Starfleet Academy. Kirk and Spock could not be more different. Yet, in their quest to figure out who they really are and what they have to give to the world, they soon become competitive cadets. With their drastically opposite styles, one driven by fiery passion, the other by rigorous logic, they also become defiant, contentious adversaries, each equally unimpressed with the other, each going all out to be among the special few chosen to join the crew of the most advanced starship ever created, the USS Enterprise. The all-star cast includes Eric Bana, Simon Pegg, Winona Ryder, Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood and Leonard Nimoy.</desc><credits><director>J.J.
