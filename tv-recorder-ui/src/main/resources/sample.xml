<title>Inspector Morse</title><desc>Morse is not the ideal policeman, his superiors think. He is prickly and sarcastic, a bachelor, an Oxford graduate, something of an intellectual snob, and he doesn't always follow protocol. But he gets results. 

Sergeant Lewis (Kevin Whately) is a plain family man, he follows orders, and the thing that keeps him from advancing in the Force is that he is a little slow. 

The show takes place in and around Oxford, where many a mysterious murder occurs.

<title>In Bruges</title><desc>Oscar-winning writer/director Martin McDonagh makes his feature directorial debut with this story of a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. Bruges is a welcoming destination for travellers, but for hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) it could be their final destination. Ralph Fiennes stars as their boss Harry, who orders the pair out of London after a difficult job. He suggests they go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks. The two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Still haunted by the London job, Ray hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own.</desc><credits><director>Martin Mcdonagh</director><actor>Colin Farrell</actor><actor>Brendan Gleeson</actor><actor>Ralph Fiennes</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Bad Neighbours</title><desc>By all appearances, new parents Mac and Kelly Radner are living the American Dream - complete with an adorable baby girl and a beautiful new starter home in the suburbs. Still, the early-thirtysomethings want to believe that they have a modicum of coolness left within them. So when they discover that their new next-door neighbours are none other than dozens of Delta Psi Beta fraternity brothers led by charismatic president Teddy Sanders, they try to play along and make the best of an awkward situation. But when the frat's parties grow increasingly more epic, both sides of the property line begin to fend for their turf. The neighbours' relentless sabotage escalates into outrageous one-upmanship, beginning an epic Greek war for the ages.</desc><credits><director>Nicholas Stoller</director><actor>Seth Rogen</actor><actor>Zac Efron</actor><actor>Rose Byrne</actor></credits><date>2014</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Movie</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>In Bruges</title><desc>Oscar-winning writer/director Martin McDonagh makes his feature directorial debut with this story of a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. Bruges is a welcoming destination for travellers, but for hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) it could be their final destination. Ralph Fiennes stars as their boss Harry, who orders the pair out of London after a difficult job. He suggests they go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks. The two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Still haunted by the London job, Ray hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own.</desc><credits><director>Martin Mcdonagh</director><actor>Colin Farrell</actor><actor>Brendan Gleeson</actor><actor>Ralph Fiennes</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

At its core, this is a story of the American spirit - the lost art of doing things the right way and the fierce desire to preserve a dying way of life from the encroaching modern world.</desc><date>2013</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

Whenever she comes up with a new lead, they toss a coin to decide whether or not they'll go. At their first stop, the guys pick the storage locker of a fellow picker named 2D. He not only has an eclectic collection but enjoys it from the comfort of his own hot tub, right in the middle of the storage unit. Also in Kentucky, Mike and Frank visit a woman who hopes to clear out some of her late father's collection. And finally, they end up at a Wisconsin farm caught up in the weird world of "Hippie Tom" where they find themselves in one of the oddest haggling sessions of their careers.

Shrimping has been part of the Gulf since the 17th century when fisherman used vertical nets up to 600 feet in diameter to scoop up the delicacy. With the invention of the flat bottom "otter trawl"along with motorised engines, the territory and depth of shrimping expanded. Currently the US harvests over half million pounds of shrimp and imports another 200 million pounds a year, more than any other country.

<title>Outback Hunters</title><sub-title>The Big One</sub-title><desc>In the desolate northern territory of the Australian Outback lies a vast wilderness called Kakadu, roamed by the Aborigines for 40,000 years and bordered by three rivers, the East, West and South Alligator Rivers. This part of the Outback has attracted the most extreme of characters for centuries. In the 1800s bushrangers, English prisoners with the best survival skills, escaped from city prisons and made this part of the country their new stomping grounds. But it wasn't the escaped convicts that struck fear into the locals; it was and still is, the "Salties", the massive saltwater crocodiles known as the biggest, baddest reptiles on the planet. This adrenaline-filled series follows a team of charismatic Aussies, as they manage and cull this highly protected species. Brave hunters cull the predators during a legitimate annual hunting season. The truly daring help manage the population by capturing prized croc eggs, swooping down on nests from helicopters flown by bush pilots.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category>

Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger.

<title>Midsomer Murders</title><sub-title>Fit For Murder</sub-title><desc>DCI Tom Barnaby bids an emotional farewell to Midsomer Murders as he tackles his last case of murder and mayhem in the picturesque but deadly villages. Barnaby hands in his police badge after over 80 episodes and 14 years in the starring role. Fit for Murder is also the final episode for Jane Wymark, who has played Barnaby's long-suffering wife Joyce since the series began in 1997, and Laura Howard, who has co-starred regularly as his daughter Cully. Midsomer's new detective DCI John Barnaby also makes an appearance. DCI John Barnaby, a cousin of Tom Barnaby, moves to Midsomer to team up with DI Ben Jones, played by established Midsomer Murders star Jason Hughes. In Fit For Murder, Barnaby reluctantly accompanies Joyce on a spa weekend to upmarket Swavely Manor. But as he attempts to de-stress amid the New Age therapies, a woman is found dead in the floatation chamber. Abandoning the treatments to investigate, Barnaby uncovers a feud between neighbours, money wrangles and the mystery of a half-written novel. But, despite the distractions of the case, Barnaby has a birthday approaching and a decision to make. His personal worries are never far from the surface.</desc><credits><actor>John Nettles</actor><actor>Daniel Casey</actor><actor>Jane Wymark</actor><actor>Laura Howard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Mystery and Suspense</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">12.7.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Who's Been Sleeping In My House</title><sub-title>Invercloy</sub-title><desc>Invercloy is a grand Federation-style home in Redcliffe, Western Australia where it stands out as a majestic mansion in a sea of suburbia. But beyond the house's visual charm, George and Pauline Christidis reckon Invercloy spins a special magic, which they can't explain. Prior to moving in two years ago, life with their four young boys was rowdy to say the least. But when they arrived at Invercloy, something short of a miracle occurred - the bickering and fighting stopped and peace descended for the first time. There's no doubt the big, rambling house afforded some breathing room for the boisterous brothers, but Pauline is convinced that the house exudes something more. Her question: what could be behind Invercloy's spell that has worked such wonders on her family? That's not the only question that hangs in the air for Adam Ford. The family is also convinced they share Invercloy's corridors with a ghostly presence, and it doesn't take long for Adam to corroborate many other tales of supposed sightings. Finally, wine lover George has a question that's more down to earth. He's heard stories that Invercloy was legendary for its hunting parties in the early twentieth century, and the thirsty guests were well serviced by the house's extensive wine cellars. But the cellars haven't been seen for 60 years, and George is keen to know if they ever existed, and if so, where they could be.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Midsomer Murders</title><sub-title>Death in the Slow Lane</sub-title><desc>The villains of Midsomer face a new adversary as Neil Dudgeon steps into John Nettles' shoes in a new series of Midsomer Murders. This much loved detective series enters a new era as DCI John Barnaby, a cousin of the original detective, moves in to fight crime in the beautiful but deadly villages and valleys of Midsomer. Neil Dudgeon makes his debut as John Barnaby in Death in the Slow Lane, alongside established Midsomer Murders sidekick DI Ben Jones, played by Jason Hughes. And in the forthcoming second film Dark Secrets, Barnaby is joined by his wife Sarah, played by Fiona Dolman. Sarah Barnaby is the new head teacher at Causton Comprehensive School. In Death in the Slow Lane new DCI John Barnaby arrives in Midsomer and is bemused by the quaint villages and their quirky residents. But when a local DJ is crushed to death at a traditional girls' boarding school, he soon discovers that murder and deception are never far away. As the death toll rises, could Barnaby's first case also be his last?</desc><credits><actor>John Nettles</actor><actor>Daniel Casey</actor><actor>Jane Wymark</actor><actor>Laura Howard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Mystery and Suspense</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">13.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Lights Camera Action Chugger</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen.

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>What Loud Music, Tombliboos!</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.22.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>It's Stormy Everywhere</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>It's Stormy Everywhere</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.23.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen.

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Hoot V Toot</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.7.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Scrub-a-chug</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.13.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.24.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>Roughing Up The Rookie</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 5</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 6</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 7</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 8</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

<title>Tropic Thunder</title><desc>Rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has been given the thankless task of shooting the studio's latest big budget film - a Vietnam war adventure. Between the acting difficulties of his lead, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the egos of Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) a "serious" Australian method actor, and Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), an obnoxious star with an addiction to more than sugar - and a studio head (Tom Cruise) who thinks he's totally incompetent - Damien has is work cut out for him. At his wits end, he takes advice from the author of the book on which the film is based - "Four Leaf" Tayback (Nick Nolte): he takes his stars out into the jungle, and drops them - no phones, no food, no escape. His plan is to shoot the action sequences live. However, Damien has unwittingly dropped them in the middle of Asia's golden triangle: the prime heroin production area, controlled by gangsters. Tuggman is taken prisoner - and it is up to his fellow actors to man up and come up with a plan to save him - and themselves.</desc><credits><director>Ben Stiller</director><actor>Ben Stiller</actor><actor>Robert Downey Jr.</actor><actor>Jack Black</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Action</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>7/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Tropic Thunder</title><desc>Rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has been given the thankless task of shooting the studio's latest big budget film - a Vietnam war adventure. Between the acting difficulties of his lead, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the egos of Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) a "serious" Australian method actor, and Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), an obnoxious star with an addiction to more than sugar - and a studio head (Tom Cruise) who thinks he's totally incompetent - Damien has is work cut out for him. At his wits end, he takes advice from the author of the book on which the film is based - "Four Leaf" Tayback (Nick Nolte): he takes his stars out into the jungle, and drops them - no phones, no food, no escape. His plan is to shoot the action sequences live. However, Damien has unwittingly dropped them in the middle of Asia's golden triangle: the prime heroin production area, controlled by gangsters. Tuggman is taken prisoner - and it is up to his fellow actors to man up and come up with a plan to save him - and themselves.</desc><credits><director>Ben Stiller</director><actor>Ben Stiller</actor><actor>Robert Downey Jr.</actor><actor>Jack Black</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Action</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>7/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Spy Kids 4: All The Time In The World</title><desc>Jessica Alba and Jeremy Piven star in this fourth installment in the Spy Kids franchise, about a former spy who is brought back to work after marrying and having a baby and tries to hide her work from her new stepkids, but when they find out, they seize the opportunity to help with the mission. Putting away her spy career after the birth of her new baby, Marissa (Jessica Alba) commits to life with her daughter and her stepchildren, Rebecca and Cecil (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook), and her husband, journalist Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale), who spends his life tracking down and exposing spies. Domestic life is short-lived, however, as Marissa is pressed back into action by the appearance of master-villian The Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven), and she is forced to reveal her true identity to the children, including the fact that the family dog, Argonaut (voice of Ricky Gervais) is a robot. Rebecca and Cecil are very impressed, but when they are spirited to OSS spy headquarters after an attempted break-in at their house, they jump at the chance to follow in both Marissa's and the original Spy Kids' (Darryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) footsteps and become Spy Kids themselves.</desc><credits><director>Robert Rodriguez</director><actor>Jessica Alba</actor><actor>Jeremy Piven</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>4/10</value></star-rating>

But to claim their native title they need to show their knowledge and ownership of the land in a way that makes sense to them and the visiting Native Title Tribunal. They decide to paint their country - on a massive scale. Seventy artists set to work on a specially made canvas measuring eight by ten metres. The richness, complexity and energy of desert life are intertwined with this creative process and the story of the Ngurrara Native Title claim itself. The film culminates in the painting's first journey to Canberra. It goes on display while adults and children sing and dance around it in celebration of their country and in anticipation of claiming it back.</desc><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Message Stick</title><sub-title>The Urab Dancers</sub-title><desc>The Urab Dancers are serving as a beacon for the young Porumagul people of the Torres Strait who believe that language and dance have something to offer them, and indeed that they have something to offer in return. They have shared their cultural performances and stories with wider audiences and this year plan to undertake a tour to several destinations on mainland Australia. What's in store for a group of young people who are now realising their cultural past holds the key to their very modern future? The Torres Strait is home to the Porumagul people of the Kulkulgal nation. This community is one of the smallest in the Torres Strait, and is keenly aware of the problems facing many Indigenous communities in Australia in their loss of cultural identity and tradition. In the past, Elders have been the cornerstone in maintaining the teaching and practice of traditional and cultural knowledge; but recently an unexpected social shift has occurred in some communities whereby the young people have become the proactive element within those roles.</desc><category>Social Issues</category><category>Current Affairs</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Uninhabited</title><desc>Geraldine Hakewill and Henry James star in this Australian horror thriller inspired by a terrifying true story about a young couple holidaying on a deserted island, where they begin to find evidence of an intruder around their retreat, who seems to resent their presence. Adventurous young lovers Harry (Henry James) and Beth (Geraldine Hakewill) excitedly travel to their remote holiday destination, a deserted island which will contain just the two of them for ten days. As they settle in for a romantic sojourn together, everything seems idyllic until several incidents begin to unsettle them. The couple's belongings are rifled through, and they discover a grave adjacent to an abandoned hut, which contains a journal detailing other people's visits to the island, which were affected by the presence of something, or someone, sinister. Finally, Beth and Harry discover footprints that are not theirs. With their fear growing, they see a person standing out on the reef, and attempt to call the island manager to come to collect them, but the menacing presence, who seems determined to get rid of them, has other plans for the two castaways.</desc><credits><director>Bill Bennett</director><actor>Geraldine Hakewill</actor><actor>Henry James</actor></credits><date>2010</date><category>Science Fiction</category><category>Horror</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

In March of 1621, Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag, negotiated a diplomatic alliance with a scraggly band of English Pilgrims for the benefit of his people. It was a gamble that paid off for several decades, as Indians and Puritans coexisted in relative peace. A half-century later, as brutal war flared between the English colonists and a confederation of New England Indians, the wisdom of Massasoit's choice seemed less clear.</desc><date>2000</date><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

When their search leads them to an unlikely foe, the club must tread lightly to reclaim their merchandise without further incident. Clay continues to try and gain member support for the upcoming vote, and resorts to devious measures to achieve his end. Meanwhile, (perhaps mistakenly) believing his stepfather to be a man of his word, Jax does his best to sway votes in favour of Clay's increasingly unpopular plan. As Assistant US Attorney Linc is forced to start his investigation into the Sons anew, he focuses his attention on new SAMCRO ally Romeo and his Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, in his effort to build a RICO case against the club, Linc enlists the help of local law enforcement to sew the seeds of distrust among one of the Sons.</desc><credits><director>Peter Weller</director><actor>Charlie Hunnam</actor><actor>Ron Perlman</actor><actor>Katey Sagal</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Drama</category><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Drama Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.2.</episode-num><rating><value>MA</value></rating>

<title>Crazy On The Outside</title><desc>After three years inside a penitentiary, Tommy Zelda (Tim Allen) is relieved to be free, but he immediately realises that the real world is far more scary than prison. His sister Viki (Sigourney Weaver), a chronic liar, has been unable to tell their family the truth about Tommy's incarceration, leading to an awkward situation when his grandmother (Helen Slayton-Hughes) asks about his trip to France. Tommy finds a job working in a fast food restaurant, where he comes across his ex-girlfriend Christy (Julie Bowen) who tries to rekindle their romance despite the presence of her fiance Frank (Kelsey Grammar). To complicate things further, a romantic connection develops between Tommy and his parole officer Angela (Jeanne Tripplehorn), while his old friend Gray (Ray Liotta) tries to convince him to take part in a robbery he's planning. Overwhelmed at every turn, Tommy is forced to figure out what is important in life and love, without getting himself in further strife.</desc><credits><director>Tim Allen</director><actor>Sigourney Weaver</actor><actor>Ray Liotta</actor><actor>Tim Allen</actor></credits><date>2010</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Movie</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>The Ark Of The Covenant</title><desc>The most famous lost treasure of them all is a wooden box, covered in gold, topped with two winged figures. According to the Bible, the Ark of the Covenant was made at Gods command, some three thousand years ago, by the Israelites, as they wandered through the desert. It was to hold the stone tablets on which the ten commandments were written, and it was also to mark the Israelites special status as Gods chosen people; and his promise - to them - his covenant - that they would have a land of their own. This documentary sets out to discover the truth behind this story, whether the ark really exists at all, and if so, its whereabouts.

After three years, 350 engineers, thousands of construction workers, tens of thousands of tons of metal, and billions of dollars, the question is: Was it all worth it? Award-winning filmmaker Rory Kennedy investigates the impact of the $3 billion project, revealing how the fence's stated goals, containing illegal immigration, cracking down on drug trafficking, and protecting America from terrorists, have given way to unforeseen, even absurd, consequences.</desc><credits><director>Rory Kennedy</director><actor>Daryl Reed</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>4/10</value></star-rating>

<title>The Island With Bear Grylls</title><desc>Generations of men have wondered if they could survive on a desert island. This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.

<title>Can We Control Gravity?</title><desc>Scientists have been fascinated with the idea of controlling gravity for over 200 years. In the mid-1990s, British aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems began a ground-breaking project code-named 'Greenglow', which set about turning science fiction into reality. NASA was simultaneously running its own Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project. Looking at these past projects and into the future, BBC's Horizon explores science's obsession with the idea of gravity control. Are flying cars and journeys to the stars still the stuff of dreams?</desc>

<title>Bronson</title><desc>"In introducing himself, Michael "Charles Bronson" Peterson (Tom Hardy) tells his audience that he sought fame from an early age, but did not have conventional talents. It is soon apparent that his talent lies in other areas, as he takes on a number of prison guards in a cage fight. Peterson's early life is shown in flashback, as his violent tendencies begin to surface at school. At the age of 19, his robbery of a post office sends him to prison for seven years, where he comes into his psychopathic element. Creating constant havoc by starting fights with prison officers sees Peterson shunted around various prisons and eventually a psychiatric hospital. He is eventually paroled, and starts boxing, taking on the stage name of Charles Bronson. Inevitably, Bronson ends up back in prison, and notches up 30 years in solitary confinement, which only heightens his distorted and evil take on reality, and ensures his infamy instead of fame."</desc><credits><director>Nicolas Winding Refn</director><actor>Tom Hardy</actor><actor>Matt King</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Biography</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Monsters</title><desc>Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able star in this feature by first time writer/director Gareth Edwards, who received a BAFTA nomination for this sci-fi thriller about a journalist who leads a young woman through a part of Mexico overrun by tentacled aliens. A space probe sent to collect evidence of aliens goes haywire and instead of returning safely, crash lands in Mexico, scattering its dangerous cargo. Six years later, a large section of the country up to the border with the United States is quarantined in a somewhat vain attempt to contain the outbreak of the lethal tentacled creatures that have overrun the land. A journalist named Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) is ordered by his boss to escort his daughter, Samantha (Whitney Able) from San Jose to the USA, and they set off on their perilous journey, which soon reveals the extent to which the alien plague has spread.</desc><credits><director>Gareth Edwards</director><actor>Scoot Mcnairy</actor><actor>Whitney Able</actor></credits><date>2010</date><category>Horror</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Made In Italy With Silvia Colloca</title><desc>Silvia Colloca, actress, opera singer and author of hit cookbook Silvias Cucina, serves up an Italy rarely seen by tourists during a culinary celebrazione. In this sumptuous and picturesque new series, Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare. In the first episode, Silvia Colloca travels through Central Italy on a culinary celebration of traditional Italian cuisine. Her breath is taken away by stunning seaside dining on the Adriatic sea, where she learns how to make zuppa di cozze (mussles in white wine broth) on a bygone fishing pier called a Trabocco. Heading inland to her family home in Torricella, Silvia calls upon locally produced white wine to create a superbly simple dish, pollo in potacchio (chicken in a pot).

<title>The Nefertiti Bust</title><desc>This documentary uncovers the extraordinary story behind one of the ancient worlds most iconic images. The blue-crowned statue of a beautiful woman, wearing the full regalia of a royal wife was officially dug out of the Amarna desert in 1912. Since that time, admirers have marvelled not only at its artistry, but at its remarkable preservation: the fact that something so delicate could have survived, virtually pristine, for three and a half thousand years. This program traces the history of the bust, and the woman behind it. Egyptologists Jacquelyn Williamson and Barry Kemp reveal Queen Nefertiti as the most powerful woman that Egypt had known. They uncover a story of political, cultural and religious revolution.

<title>The Ark Of The Covenant</title><desc>The most famous lost treasure of them all is a wooden box, covered in gold, topped with two winged figures. According to the Bible, the Ark of the Covenant was made at Gods command, some three thousand years ago, by the Israelites, as they wandered through the desert. It was to hold the stone tablets on which the ten commandments were written, and it was also to mark the Israelites special status as Gods chosen people; and his promise - to them - his covenant - that they would have a land of their own. This documentary sets out to discover the truth behind this story, whether the ark really exists at all, and if so, its whereabouts.

<title>The Island With Bear Grylls</title><desc>Generations of men have wondered if they could survive on a desert island. This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.

<title>Can We Control Gravity?</title><desc>Scientists have been fascinated with the idea of controlling gravity for over 200 years. In the mid-1990s, British aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems began a ground-breaking project code-named 'Greenglow', which set about turning science fiction into reality. NASA was simultaneously running its own Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project. Looking at these past projects and into the future, BBC's Horizon explores science's obsession with the idea of gravity control. Are flying cars and journeys to the stars still the stuff of dreams?</desc>

<title>Bronson</title><desc>"In introducing himself, Michael "Charles Bronson" Peterson (Tom Hardy) tells his audience that he sought fame from an early age, but did not have conventional talents. It is soon apparent that his talent lies in other areas, as he takes on a number of prison guards in a cage fight. Peterson's early life is shown in flashback, as his violent tendencies begin to surface at school. At the age of 19, his robbery of a post office sends him to prison for seven years, where he comes into his psychopathic element. Creating constant havoc by starting fights with prison officers sees Peterson shunted around various prisons and eventually a psychiatric hospital. He is eventually paroled, and starts boxing, taking on the stage name of Charles Bronson. Inevitably, Bronson ends up back in prison, and notches up 30 years in solitary confinement, which only heightens his distorted and evil take on reality, and ensures his infamy instead of fame."</desc><credits><director>Nicolas Winding Refn</director><actor>Tom Hardy</actor><actor>Matt King</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Biography</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

A space probe sent to collect evidence of aliens goes haywire and instead of returning safely, crash lands in Mexico, scattering its dangerous cargo. Six years later, a large section of the country up to the border with the United States is quarantined in a somewhat vain attempt to contain the outbreak of the lethal tentacled creatures that have overrun the land. A journalist named Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) is ordered by his boss to escort his daughter, Samantha (Whitney Able) from San Jose to the USA, and they set off on their perilous journey, which soon reveals the extent to which the alien plague has spread.</desc><credits><director>Gareth Edwards</director><actor>Scoot Mcnairy</actor><actor>Whitney Able</actor></credits><date>2010</date><category>Horror</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>The Nefertiti Bust</title><desc>This documentary uncovers the extraordinary story behind one of the ancient worlds most iconic images. The blue-crowned statue of a beautiful woman, wearing the full regalia of a royal wife was officially dug out of the Amarna desert in 1912. Since that time, admirers have marvelled not only at its artistry, but at its remarkable preservation: the fact that something so delicate could have survived, virtually pristine, for three and a half thousand years. This program traces the history of the bust, and the woman behind it. Egyptologists Jacquelyn Williamson and Barry Kemp reveal Queen Nefertiti as the most powerful woman that Egypt had known. They uncover a story of political, cultural and religious revolution.

Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.
