<title>Grey's Anatomy</title><sub-title>Get up, stand up</sub-title><desc>As April and Matthew's wedding day draws near, the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital prepare for the big day while dealing with their own issues. Derek is working with a federal initiative that wants to use his name to support their work, but he refuses their offer because he is supposed to be cutting back so that Meredith can take more time for her research. Alex starts to get along with his dad, but it comes to a halting stop when his dad starts talking poorly of his mother. Meredith and Cristina have the ultimate throw down while getting fitted for their bridesmaid dresses, but when they show up to April's wedding, they start to mend their differences by accepting that they are in different places. Bailey tells Ben that it's essentially his fault for her OCD troubles because her symptoms only worsened when he quit surgery. Jimmy requires emergency heart surgery, and Shane rushes him into the OR; however, Webber has to take over when Shane begins to relive Brooks' death. During April and Matthew's wedding, Derek gets a call from the President of the United States, and Jackson stands up and confesses his love for April.</desc><credits><actor>Ellen Pompeo</actor><actor>Patrick Dempsey</actor><actor>Katherine Heigl</actor><actor>Sandra Oh</actor><actor>T.R.

To "help out" in the matter, Albert offers a solution in the form of his own daughter, Princess Kirsten (Clemency Burton-Hill), a childhood friend of Edvard's that has blossomed into an attractive and graceful adult. The Danish tabloids are swarming for juicy gossip, setting forth a chain of events that threatens to make Edvard have to choose between his kingdom and his heart.</desc><credits><director>Catherine Cyran</director><actor>Luke Mably</actor><actor>Jonathan Firth</actor><actor>Kam Heskin</actor></credits><date>2006</date><category>Romantic Comedy</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>4/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Grey's Anatomy</title><sub-title>Take It Back</sub-title><desc>After a short prologue in which April and Jackson drive off together - April still hesitant over her actions - and Arizona tries to end her marriage with Callie, the episode skips to "three weeks later". Meredith is upset with Derek for agreeing to the President's offer, which means going back on his promise to her to take a back seat to her research. Callie and Arizona buy a new house that'll be theirs together, with Arizona wanting to give their relationship one last new start. Chief Hunt begins to ride Ross aggressively in the ER, not just after the botched surgery with Jimmy but (according to an accusative Webber) because he has learned that Ross had been sleeping with Cristina. Alex's emotional plea to Jo turns out to, in his mind, have been a marriage proposal; Jo turns him down, claiming they're not ready, but continues to stand by him when Jimmy passes away. Bailey and Ben start talking and working through his arrival. She tells him that she's worried that he'll be at home waiting on her just like Tucker used to do, and he resumes his internship... at Grey Sloan. Stephanie is having a hard time accepting that Jackson broke up with her for April and, with Leah's encouragement, someone anonymously files an HR complaint on behalf of the interns concerning sexual harassment from their attendings. In response, the HR department implements a strict non-fraternization policy on the spot... which could prove problematic for April and Jackson, who are revealed to have eloped three weeks ago.</desc><credits><actor>Ellen Pompeo</actor><actor>Patrick Dempsey</actor><actor>Katherine Heigl</actor><actor>Sandra Oh</actor><actor>T.R.

<title>American Pickers</title><sub-title>Trading Up</sub-title><desc>Mike and Frank head to Ohio and decide to make the trip a little more interesting by bringing along a cup dispenser from an old train station to trade with their clients, hoping to make some cash. They meet Will, the son of an auctioneer who has inherited a house packed with his dad's collection and is coming to terms with letting the stuff go. The guys pick up tons of items, including an antique accordion on which Frank shows off his musical talents! Next, they truck to Indiana to meet a small town historian who takes everyone's collectibles for safe keeping. There, they purchase a St. Louis Cardinals vintage baseball poster and Frank falls in love with a pinball machine featuring Happy Days' the Fonz. Finally, Mike gets to experience his dream pick at a VW graveyard in Illinois, but Frank is the one who strikes gold when he buys a rare BSA motorcycle. In small towns, and along America's back roads, treasures are waiting to be uncovered, valuable relics from history that are hidden in junk piles, buried in barns and stacked in garages. It takes special experts to find these lost artifacts and hopefully turn rust to riches. AMERICAN PICKERS follows two of the most skilled "pickers" Mike Wolfe, owner of Antique Archaeology, and his business partner, Frank Fritz, as they hunt down objects with historical, collectible and pop culture value that have been long forgotten by their owners. Along the way, they meet people whose own stories open a window into American lives and history.</desc><date>2010</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.6.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>American Pickers</title><sub-title>Keep Out!</sub-title><desc>Driving along the back roads of Tennessee in the early morning fog, Mike and Frank are brushing up on their Southern expressions when they spot an awesome property. Once they muster up the courage to ignore the scary 'no trespassing' signs, the homeowner opens up his amazing collection of incredible "mantiques". Later, with four barns that are packed to the rafters, a Smokey Mountain property looks perfect. But Mike and Frank's perfect day quickly goes downhill when the collector can't bear to part with anything. Can they break the ice or will their picking spirit be broken first? And, thanks to a lead from Danielle, the guys get a warm welcome from Joe, a lifetime picker whose staggering collection spans over 30 buildings. In small towns, and along America's back roads, treasures are waiting to be uncovered, valuable relics from history that are hidden in junk piles, buried in barns and stacked in garages. It takes special experts to find these lost artifacts and hopefully turn rust to riches. American Pickers follows two of the most skilled "pickers" Mike Wolfe, owner of Antique Archaeology, and his business partner, Frank Fritz, as they hunt down objects with historical, collectible and pop culture value that have been long forgotten by their owners. Along the way, they meet people whose own stories open a window into American lives and history.</desc><date>2010</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.8.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

They're going to someone who needs their expertise to make his home unique. The owner is William Shatner, who gives Mike and Frank a very specific list. While Danielle looks for leads, the picking is red hot at Thurman's Tennessee hills property. The lifetime collector says he's ready to make a deal, but is he really? Next, the guys hunt for the perfect showpiece for Shatner's garden and think they've hit the jackpot with an amazing millstone collector. That is, until they find out his prices outweigh even the heaviest of stones. And, with just one week to deliver the goods to their celebrity client, Mike and Frank call in a favour from a designer friend. Finally, with a van full of treasures, they deliver their booty to Shatner, hoping they haven't let him down.

<title>American Pickers</title><sub-title>The Possum Trot</sub-title><desc>While cruising through South Carolina, looking for leads, the guys call an old picking contact and soon find themselves in Bill's main street hardware store. The family business has been operating since the 1880s and is filled to the rafters with century-old inventory. In the backwoods of Alabama, the guys are invited to the Possum Trot? a down-home country auction where the bidding is intense, and the guys try to auction a few of their items. Later, Ed's Georgia property features a missile on the lawn, and building after building of awesome stuff. And, for the first time, he says he's ready to part with a few of his treasures! Mike spies a must-have German leather pilot's helmet and a rare ship's compass. And after scoring an entire shelf of brand new vintage model car kits, Frank discovers the real challenge is getting a giant Victrola banner down from the rafters. In small towns, and along America's back roads, treasures are waiting to be uncovered, valuable relics from history that are hidden in junk piles, buried in barns and stacked in garages. It takes special experts to find these lost artifacts and hopefully turn rust to riches. AMERICAN PICKERS follows two of the most skilled "pickers" Mike Wolfe, owner of Antique Archaeology, and his business partner, Frank Fritz, as they hunt down objects with historical, collectible and pop culture value that have been long forgotten by their owners. Along the way, they meet people whose own stories open a window into American lives and history.</desc><date>2010</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.10.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Swamp People</title><sub-title>Unbreakable Bonds</sub-title><desc>In the farthest corner of Louisiana lies the nation's largest swamp - a hidden world where nature rules and man fights back. The Cajuns that live in this forbidding environment follow traditions dating back three hundred years, to the earliest pioneers. They are Swamp People, inheritors of a tradition of self-reliance and fierce independence that makes them true American originals. Follow these swampers through the most important time of their year - the thirty day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a story of the American spirit - the lost art of doing things the right way and the fierce desire to preserve a dying way of life from the encroaching modern world.</desc><date>2014</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.17.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

But trawling bars in Manchester dressed up to the nines, tottering on stilettos, and ready to pull has not produced a lasting or truly fulfilling relationship. Then, as fate would have it, Tracie falls head over heels in love in unexpected circumstances following an altercation with some blokes out on a stag night. One of the stag revellers, Tony a satellite and aerial engineer, comes to Tracie's aid and offers her a lift home. Tony and Tracie are smitten and hesitatingly their love affair begins. But Tony has a secret too - he's married to a local beautician, Karen, and he cares deeply for his wife. Before long Tracie has unwittingly become entangled in a triangular love affair that leads inexorably to a terrible crime of passion and the dock.</desc><credits><actor>Sean Bean</actor><actor>Stephen Graham</actor></credits><date>2012</date><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Midsomer Murders</title><sub-title>The Sleeper Under The Hill</sub-title><desc>When the body of a farmer is found in the middle of a stone circle in Midsomer Mow suspicion is pointed at local druids. The murdered man, Alex Preston, had planned to plough Gorse Meadow, making Crowcall Circle inaccessible to the group led by high priests Ezra Canning and Leticia Clifford. Barnaby and Jones are joined in their investigation by new pathologist Kate Wilding. Local copper Sgt Gibson brings Jones up to speed with local gossip - Ezra had been cautioned for issuing threats against Preston. Meanwhile, the dead man's widow Eleanor has disappeared. Later that night, a gutted hare is left on the bloodstone and historian Caradoc Singer tells Barnaby it's a warning. Eleanor returns, claiming to have been with friends. However, Sgt Gibson says he saw her car in Causton. Her phone calls link her to fencing coach Aidan Hardy. At her cottage, Leticia shows Barnaby that sacred ley lines run through the stone circle. Later, she phones Ezra, convinced she has made an exciting discovery. But before she can share her theory, she is stabbed to death. Evan Jago, a poacher and petty thief, attacks Sgt Gibson and disappears after a charity box is stolen from the village pub.</desc><credits><actor>John Nettles</actor><actor>Daniel Casey</actor><actor>Jane Wymark</actor><actor>Laura Howard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Mystery and Suspense</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">13.4.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Mind the Haahoos</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.32.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>Yin &amp; Yang</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again.

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Wake Up Ball</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.33.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

He was shot at 41 times, hit 19 times. The question was why? Louis sets out to find out more. "Many of the inhabitants of Harlem believe that white people are devils...

<title>Deadly 60</title><sub-title>South Africa 1</sub-title><desc>From tiger sharks to giant centipedes, funnel web spiders to the golden poison frog; Steve Backshall's latest adventure is a race against time to find the creatures, others spend a lifetime avoiding. Travelling across six continents over six months, Steve searches through trees, deserts, swamps and seas in his bid to find the 60 deadliest creatures on the planet. Episode 1: South Africa 1 - Wednesday 19th May This high-adrenalin series nearly gets off to the worst possible start due to an unplanned run-in with an angry hippo which causes utter chaos and comes within a whisker of attacking Steve. Shaken but undaunted, Steve wants to know which local snake is the deadliest: the black mamba, the rock python or the rhinkal? Then it's a night under the stars camping in the bush on the hunt for giant spiders and a scorpion that can spray its venom in your face! Episode 2: South Africa 2 - Thursday 20th May When a Nile crocodile attacks a local six-year-old girl in her swimming pool, Steve makes it his mission to investigate whether these ancient reptiles truly deserve their deadly reputation. In true Steve style, there is a lot of climbing and a certain amount of falling involved as he puts himself against the soaring Fish Eagle in a power dive competition to catch a fish. Will Steve be able to mimic the eagle's masterful skills? Finally, he's hot on the trail of Africa's most elusive large predator, the Hunting Dog. Searching the bush by foot, by jeep and by air for this rare creature, gives him the opportunity to see just how good the hunting dogs are.</desc><credits><actor>Steve Backshall</actor></credits><category>Nature</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>ScienceNatureTechnology</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>The Mysterious Cities Of Gold</title><sub-title>Secret Of The Temple</sub-title><desc>The year is 1532. Esteban, a young boy, is told that he was saved by Mendoza, a navigator on a Spanish ship, from a ship wreck in a storm at sea. The only clue to his identity is a medal that Esteban wears about his neck. Esteban joins Mendoza on a trip from Spain to the new world - the Americas - where en route he meets two other children - Zia, an Inca girl, and Tao, the last member of a highly advanced race. All three are looking for different things - Esteban, to find his father and his identity; Zia, for her father; and Tao, for remains of his race. The clues for all three quests, however, all point to the seven Cities of Gold and so the children, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro - two other sailors and friends of Mendoza start searching in a massive treasure hunt for the Cities Of Gold.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

Esteban, a young boy, is told that he was saved by Mendoza, a navigator on a Spanish ship, from a ship wreck in a storm at sea. The only clue to his identity is a medal that Esteban wears about his neck. Esteban joins Mendoza on a trip from Spain to the new world - the Americas - where en route he meets two other children - Zia, an Inca girl, and Tao, the last member of a highly advanced race. All three are looking for different things - Esteban, to find his father and his identity; Zia, for her father; and Tao, for remains of his race. The clues for all three quests, however, all point to the seven Cities of Gold and so the children, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro - two other sailors and friends of Mendoza start searching in a massive treasure hunt for the Cities Of Gold.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>First Australians</title><sub-title>They Have Come To Stay</sub-title><desc>First Australians chronicles the birth of contemporary Australia as never told before, from the perspective of its first people. The series explores what unfolds when the oldest living culture in the world is overrun by the world's greatest empire. Over seven episodes, First Australians depicts the true stories of individuals - both black and white - caught in an epic drama of friendship, revenge, loss and victory in Australia's most transformative period of history. The story begins in 1788 in Sydney, with the friendship between an Englishmen (Governor Phillip) and a warrior (Bennelong) and ends in 1993 with Koiki Mabo's legal challenge to the foundation of Australia. First Australians chronicles the collision of two worlds and the genesis of a new nation. In the first episode, the first Australians and the powerful British Empire come face to face. Friendships quickly form despite immense differences, but within three years both sides are locked in a battle for land and survival.

With its thrilling speed, liquid-cooled engine and exterior frame, the V-Rod represents a number of important firsts for Harley-Davidson. At the Harley-Davidson factory in Kansas City, US, it is up to the engineers, designers and factory workers to ensure the V-Rod can handle the high speeds for which it was designed, whilst maintaining the signature Harley-Davidson style consumers have come to love. Robots engage in a carefully choreographed dance to create the motorcycle's unique frame and remove any kinks. The engine assembly line, which puts together the V-Rod's powerful V-Twin engine, includes miniature cameras that monitor for any missing parts. Inside this mega factory, workers also build the V-Rod's custom-made cousins: Screamin' Eagle V-Rod and the Screamin' Eagle V-Rod Destroyer, the fastest factory-built drag racer ever made</desc><date>0</date><category>Technology</category><category>Science</category><category>ScienceNatureTechnology</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

With its thrilling speed, liquid-cooled engine and exterior frame, the V-Rod represents a number of important firsts for Harley-Davidson. At the Harley-Davidson factory in Kansas City, US, it is up to the engineers, designers and factory workers to ensure the V-Rod can handle the high speeds for which it was designed, whilst maintaining the signature Harley-Davidson style consumers have come to love. Robots engage in a carefully choreographed dance to create the motorcycle's unique frame and remove any kinks. The engine assembly line, which puts together the V-Rod's powerful V-Twin engine, includes miniature cameras that monitor for any missing parts. Inside this mega factory, workers also build the V-Rod's custom-made cousins: Screamin' Eagle V-Rod and the Screamin' Eagle V-Rod Destroyer, the fastest factory-built drag racer ever made</desc><date>0</date><category>Technology</category><category>Science</category><category>ScienceNatureTechnology</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Megafactories</title><sub-title>Harley-Davidson</sub-title><desc>The Harley-Davidson V-Rod is the first Harley-Davidson motorcycle to go from 0 to 96 kilometres per hour in just 3.52 seconds - nearly twice as fast as any other Harley-Davidson bike. With its thrilling speed, liquid-cooled engine and exterior frame, the V-Rod represents a number of important firsts for Harley-Davidson. At the Harley-Davidson factory in Kansas City, US, it is up to the engineers, designers and factory workers to ensure the V-Rod can handle the high speeds for which it was designed, whilst maintaining the signature Harley-Davidson style consumers have come to love. Robots engage in a carefully choreographed dance to create the motorcycle's unique frame and remove any kinks. The engine assembly line, which puts together the V-Rod's powerful V-Twin engine, includes miniature cameras that monitor for any missing parts. Inside this mega factory, workers also build the V-Rod's custom-made cousins: Screamin' Eagle V-Rod and the Screamin' Eagle V-Rod Destroyer, the fastest factory-built drag racer ever made</desc><date>0</date><category>Technology</category><category>Science</category><category>ScienceNatureTechnology</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num><rating><value>G</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Star Trek</title><desc>The greatest adventure of all time begins with a young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the USS Enterprise. In the midst of an incredible journey full of optimism, intrigue, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind. The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals born worlds apart. James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy, a natural-born leader in search of a cause and Spock (Zachary Quinto), reared on the planet Vulcan, an outcast due to his half-human background, which makes him susceptible to the volatile emotions that Vulcans have long lived without, and yet an ingenious, determined student, who will become the first of his kind accepted into the Starfleet Academy. Kirk and Spock could not be more different. Yet, in their quest to figure out who they really are and what they have to give to the world, they soon become competitive cadets. With their drastically opposite styles, one driven by fiery passion, the other by rigorous logic, they also become defiant, contentious adversaries, each equally unimpressed with the other, each going all out to be among the special few chosen to join the crew of the most advanced starship ever created, the USS Enterprise. The all-star cast includes Eric Bana, Simon Pegg, Winona Ryder, Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood and Leonard Nimoy.</desc><credits><director>J.J.

<title>Territory Cops</title><sub-title>Fishy Drivers/a Race Against Time/hells Angels</sub-title><desc>Constables Sean "Wombat" Holmes and Luke McIntosh are on their regular night patrol when they notice a car driving without lights on. As they move to follow the vehicle, the driver races off at top speed. It's a dangerous race to catch the driver, who clearly has something to hide - and its not just the old fish in his boot. It's a desperate race to save a life when Sergeant Amee Meredith comes across a woman staggering along the side of the road late at night. As the woman collapses in front of her, Amee discovers an empty bottle of sleeping pills and a "sorry" note that quickly suggests this is not a run-of-the-mill case of intoxication. Sergeant Sean Patterson and Senior Constable Josh Streeter are on their regular weekend City Safe patrol. Word is some notorious bikie gang members are in town. Sean and Josh soon track them down to a pub where one well-built punter has decided to try and take them on, all by himself. Talking the foolhardy big bloke down, takes all of Josh's powers of persuasion.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.7.</episode-num><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Territory Cops</title><sub-title>Underwear Optional/peak Hour T-bone/history Repeat</sub-title><desc>It's the night of Darwin's Annual Hooker Ball, and Senior Constable Josh Streeter and the City Safe team are standing by to make sure the X-rated partygoers behave themselves. With a fair few 'cheeky chaps' around, these coppers are prepared to tackle anything and everything. It's Friday afternoon and shift supervisor Amee Meredith is looking forward to the weekend when she gets a call about a major traffic accident involving a government vehicle. It's happened just before knock-off time in Darwin city, and the scene isn't pretty. But unlike most car-crash cases, the two drivers know each other; in fact, they met for the first time that very morning. It's a quiet Sunday morning for NT police in Nightcliff, but little do they know this beachside suburb could be blown off the map in a matter of seconds. Sergeant Steve Wedding and Constable Dennis Hogan answer an urgent call from a groundsman who has made the shocking discovery of what appears to be an unexploded WWII bomb. It's an anxious wait as army personnel are brought in to assess the situation. Constable Sean Stanley and Probationary Constable Warwick Baldwin both share a love for fishing. They're out on a search for some of the best mud crabs and barramundi that Darwin's waterways have to offer. Taking particular care when it comes to fishing regulations, these coppers show that they know exactly what they're doing both in and out of the water. Sergeant Bernard Marsh takes charge of closing time on Mitchell Street, as he and the other City Safe officers try to ensure all the punters head home safely. It's a job Bernard knows all too well, but one that continues to provide plenty of surprises, and laughs, for police and punters alike. It's nights like these that give a whole new meaning to the notion of street entertainment Darwin style.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Dance On Screen</title><desc>Hosted by former Bangarra dancer and choreographer, Frances Rings, Dance on Screen - a two-part special - celebrates the wonderful world of dance. THE SHAPE OF WATERM The Shape of Water is the most recent dance film by the talented, award-winning team of director Cordelia Beresford and choreographer Narelle Benjamin. Narelle Benjamin got the idea for the film from a recurring dream she had of a house teetering on the edge of a cliff above a raging ocean. Beresford realises this vision as a gothic fairy-tale landscape and uses her dancers to convey the different shapes water can take - ultimately exploring the connections between water and the human mind. Director: Cordelia Beresford. Producer: Brooke Wilson. Concept and Choreography: Narelle Benjamin. Performed by members of Sydney Dance Company. Executive Producer: Megan Harding. BREAK Break, a hauntingly beautiful New Zealand film, has won a swag of international awards including Best Film in the New York Dance On Camera Festival and the People's Choice Award in Australia's ReelDance Festival. Break is a testament to the power of storytelling through dance. Director/writer/choreographer: Shona McCullagh.

<title>Wild Brazil</title><desc>Brazil is the wild heart of South America, home to more species than any other country on the planet. But it is also a land of extremes, where animals must learn to adapt to survive. This series follows the intimate lives of an exceptional set of animal characters as time moves from the vast floods of the wet season to the ravaging fires of the dry season. In tonight's first episode, three charismatic animal families, capuchin monkeys, giant otters and coatis, strive to raise their families against a backdrop of extraordinary landscapes and huge extremes of weather - a beautiful yet dangerous world full of jaguars and caimans. An intimate journey to the heart of a spectacular country, this first chapter of the trilogy sees the babies taking their first steps during a brief pause between seasonal extremes.

<title>California High</title><desc>When California introduced medical marijuana laws in 1996 it sparked a chain reaction that led to 18 other states passing similar laws. Two states, Washington and Colorado, even legalised marijuana for recreational use. With a full legalisation vote due in 2016, California is now considered by many as the key battleground state in the national marijuana debate. A debate that has divided Americans for over fifty years. From the concrete jungles of LA to the remote isolation of Northern California, "California High" takes you on a journey through the eyes of growers, cops, politicians and ordinary Californians to get up close and personal with the issues. It shows for the first time how truly complex the situation is.</desc><category>Documentary</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>The Classic Car Show</title><desc>This new 13-part series, hosted by journalist Quentin Willson and supermodel Jodie Kidd, provides unprecedented access to the iconic cars, personalities and events that underpin the classic car world. It's an emotional start for the series as Quentin falls in love with the automotive icon that sums up the feel-good 60s American Dream - the Ford Mustang. At London Fashion Week, we compare a million-dollar classic Mercedes against its modern counterpart in the classic desirability stakes. There's a $10,000 classic that divides opinion like Brussels sprouts, and we follow classic car expert Chris Routledge as he discovers a finny 60s gem thats been forgotten in a hedge for thirty years. Meanwhile, Jodie goes all misty-eyed when she takes the wheel of a $10 million Ferrari California Spider V12. (S.1,Ep.1) (From the UK) PG CC</desc><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

Dr Richard Miles travels through the ages of the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and into the modern day, to discover how we have tried to understand our ancient past over the last 2,000 years of hotly fought history. He explains how human fascination with the mysteries of the ancient past has created a legacy of wonder, discovery, and debate.

<title>Salute</title><desc>Salute is a journey back to the 1960s to examine what has now become one of the most famous Olympic moments in history. During this era the world was just three years away from the Cuban missile crisis and the threat of nuclear war, the horror of Vietnam, the assassinations of John F. and Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. There was an urgent push for civil rights. Black nations were threatening to boycott the Olympics in protest and black athletes within the US team were being urged to boycott the Games. Into this atmosphere walked Peter Norman, whose performance had taken the US team by surprise. Who was this unknown sprinter from Cobury, Vic., Australia? He wasn't a typical sprinter - he was quietly spoken, short-legged and white. In the 200-metres final, he ran the race of his life and split Tommie Smith and John Carlos, winning silver. As they waited for the presentation ceremony, Smith and Carlos told Peter of their plans. One had left behind his pair of black gloves, and at Peter's suggestion, they wore one each. Despite it not being a situation that affected him directly, Peter asked the Americans if he could join their protest. He felt there was a moral imperative on him to stand up against something he felt was wrong. Like Tommie and John, Peter wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of their silent protest. The image of the three of them on the dais, heads bowed, the Americans delivering the 'Black Salute', is regarded as one of the most powerful images of the 20th Century. Lasting repercussions followed. Smith and Carlos were dropped from the relays and the team. They were kicked out of the Olympics and banned for life. Peter Norman died of a heart attack on 3 October, 2006 aged 64. The US Track and Field Federation proclaimed the day of his funeral, 9 October, 2006, Peter Norman Day. Smith and Carlos gave eulogies and were pallbearers.</desc><credits><director>Matt Norman</director><actor>Peter Norman</actor><actor>John Carlos</actor><actor>Tommie Smith</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>5/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Dance On Screen</title><desc>Hosted by former Bangarra dancer and choreographer, Frances Rings, Dance on Screen - a two-part special - celebrates the wonderful world of dance. THE SHAPE OF WATERM The Shape of Water is the most recent dance film by the talented, award-winning team of director Cordelia Beresford and choreographer Narelle Benjamin. Narelle Benjamin got the idea for the film from a recurring dream she had of a house teetering on the edge of a cliff above a raging ocean. Beresford realises this vision as a gothic fairy-tale landscape and uses her dancers to convey the different shapes water can take - ultimately exploring the connections between water and the human mind. Director: Cordelia Beresford. Producer: Brooke Wilson. Concept and Choreography: Narelle Benjamin. Performed by members of Sydney Dance Company. Executive Producer: Megan Harding. BREAK Break, a hauntingly beautiful New Zealand film, has won a swag of international awards including Best Film in the New York Dance On Camera Festival and the People's Choice Award in Australia's ReelDance Festival. Break is a testament to the power of storytelling through dance. Director/writer/choreographer: Shona McCullagh.

It's an emotional start for the series as Quentin falls in love with the automotive icon that sums up the feel-good 60s American Dream - the Ford Mustang. At London Fashion Week, we compare a million-dollar classic Mercedes against its modern counterpart in the classic desirability stakes. There's a $10,000 classic that divides opinion like Brussels sprouts, and we follow classic car expert Chris Routledge as he discovers a finny 60s gem thats been forgotten in a hedge for thirty years. Meanwhile, Jodie goes all misty-eyed when she takes the wheel of a $10 million Ferrari California Spider V12. (S.1,Ep.1) (From the UK) PG CC</desc><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>A Pang For Brasil</title><desc>The hilariously awkward and definitely not Brasilian Sam Pang sets off to discover what makes Brasilians the coolest race on the planet as excitement builds around the host nation of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Sam Pang begins his Brasilian adventure in Rio de Janeiro, the beautiful city of beautiful people. With the help of local comedian Veronica Debom, Sam experiences a Carioca makeover, and after a wax and shopping trip for a sunga, (the Brasilian budgie smuggler) is unleashed onto the beach.

<title>Salute</title><desc>Salute is a journey back to the 1960s to examine what has now become one of the most famous Olympic moments in history. During this era the world was just three years away from the Cuban missile crisis and the threat of nuclear war, the horror of Vietnam, the assassinations of John F. and Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. There was an urgent push for civil rights. Black nations were threatening to boycott the Olympics in protest and black athletes within the US team were being urged to boycott the Games. Into this atmosphere walked Peter Norman, whose performance had taken the US team by surprise. Who was this unknown sprinter from Cobury, Vic., Australia? He wasn't a typical sprinter - he was quietly spoken, short-legged and white. In the 200-metres final, he ran the race of his life and split Tommie Smith and John Carlos, winning silver. As they waited for the presentation ceremony, Smith and Carlos told Peter of their plans. One had left behind his pair of black gloves, and at Peter's suggestion, they wore one each. Despite it not being a situation that affected him directly, Peter asked the Americans if he could join their protest. He felt there was a moral imperative on him to stand up against something he felt was wrong. Like Tommie and John, Peter wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of their silent protest. The image of the three of them on the dais, heads bowed, the Americans delivering the 'Black Salute', is regarded as one of the most powerful images of the 20th Century. Lasting repercussions followed. Smith and Carlos were dropped from the relays and the team. They were kicked out of the Olympics and banned for life. Peter Norman died of a heart attack on 3 October, 2006 aged 64. The US Track and Field Federation proclaimed the day of his funeral, 9 October, 2006, Peter Norman Day. Smith and Carlos gave eulogies and were pallbearers.</desc><credits><director>Matt Norman</director><actor>Peter Norman</actor><actor>John Carlos</actor><actor>Tommie Smith</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>5/10</value></star-rating>

Each week, the teams roll into a different city and have a weekend to create and sell items from their food truck. The team that makes the least profit is eliminated, until only one truck remains to win their custom food truck and some starting funds. This week, the truck owners embark down historic Route 66, stopping in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, for their first Truck Stop Cooking Challenge. The first team to sell 20 orders of their twist on fish and chips will get a bonus that might be enough to keep them safe from elimination.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num><rating><value>G</value></rating>

The fate of humanity rests in this delicate balance between good and evil but that fate is in jeopardy. Ancient prophecy foretells that one day a "Great One" will arrive who can end the apocalyptic battle between Light and Dark conclusively. That time has arrived in Moscow - but which side will the Great One choose? Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, Night Watch was the official Russian selection for the 2005 Academy Awards. In Anton's apartment, a reproduction of Rembrandt's painting "Nightwatch" can be briefly seen reflected in a window.</desc><credits><director>Timur Bekmambetov</director><actor>Konstantin Khabensky</actor><actor>Mariya Poroshina</actor><actor>Vladimir Menshov</actor></credits><date>2004</date><category>Thriller</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Fameless</title><desc>This new comedy prank show takes a light-hearted look at how far people will go for a chance to become famous. Each week, the series features a group of unsuspecting wannabe stars who believe they've been cast on a reality show. However, unbeknownst to them, they are really filming a parody with actors creating over-the-top scenarios that steadily increase the absurdity and ridiculousness of each situation. In the series premiere, a guitarist and karate master nearly come to blows at an audition, a wannabe cop gets lured into a high-speed chase down memory lane, and a fierce competitor learns the naked truth: that this is actually a prank show.

<title>Night At The Museum II</title><desc>Night has fallen upon the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The guides have gone home, the lights are out, the school kids are tucked in their beds... yet something incredible is stirring. Ben Stiller stars as former night guard Larry Daley, who finds himself lured into his biggest, most imagination-boggling adventure yet in which history truly comes alive. Larry must try to save his formerly inanimate friends when they are packed into crates, awaiting shipment to the Smithsonian's vast archives. The support cast includes Owen Wilson, Amy Adams, Robin Williams, Hank Azaria, Ricky Gervais and Christopher Guest. This is the first action-adventure film ever shot at the Smithsonian Institution, the largest and most visited museum in the world.</desc><credits><director>Shawn Levy</director><actor>Ben Stiller</actor><actor>Amy Adams</actor><actor>Owen Wilson</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>5/10</value></star-rating>
