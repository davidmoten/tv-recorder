Sergeant Lewis (Kevin Whately) is a plain family man, he follows orders, and the thing that keeps him from advancing in the Force is that he is a little slow. 

The show takes place in and around Oxford, where many a mysterious murder occurs.

<title>In Bruges</title><desc>Oscar-winning writer/director Martin McDonagh makes his feature directorial debut with this story of a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. Bruges is a welcoming destination for travellers, but for hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) it could be their final destination. Ralph Fiennes stars as their boss Harry, who orders the pair out of London after a difficult job. He suggests they go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks. The two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Still haunted by the London job, Ray hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own.</desc><credits><director>Martin Mcdonagh</director><actor>Colin Farrell</actor><actor>Brendan Gleeson</actor><actor>Ralph Fiennes</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

Shrimping has been part of the Gulf since the 17th century when fisherman used vertical nets up to 600 feet in diameter to scoop up the delicacy. With the invention of the flat bottom "otter trawl"along with motorised engines, the territory and depth of shrimping expanded.

Follow these swampers through the most important time of their year - the thirty day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a story of the American spirit - the lost art of doing things the right way and the fierce desire to preserve a dying way of life from the encroaching modern world.</desc><date>2013</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

And, in Illinois they come across Greg, who claims he's a psychic picker. He's filled his mammoth home, a former prison, with rare objects and cultural artifacts. But is anything for sale? Plus the guys challenge Danielle to sell an old Studebaker they had picked.

<title>Outback Hunters</title><sub-title>Killer Instinct</sub-title><desc>In the desolate northern territory of the Australian Outback lies a vast wilderness called Kakadu, roamed by the Aborigines for 40,000 years and bordered by three rivers, the East, West and South Alligator Rivers. This part of the Outback has attracted the most extreme of characters for centuries. In the 1800s bushrangers, English prisoners with the best survival skills, escaped from city prisons and made this part of the country their new stomping grounds. But it wasn't the escaped convicts that struck fear into the locals; it was and still is, the "Salties", the massive saltwater crocodiles known as the biggest, baddest reptiles on the planet. This adrenaline-filled series follows a team of charismatic Aussies, as they manage and cull this highly protected species. Brave hunters cull the predators during a legitimate annual hunting season. The truly daring help manage the population by capturing prized croc eggs, swooping down on nests from helicopters flown by bush pilots.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category>

It doesn't get much better in a small town they come across. There, they spot some great vintage garage signs, and although they're not for sale, Ken has room after room of unusual items, including an early bicycle and rare Victorian-era erotica. But their luck really changes when Danielle calls with a lead about Hobo Jack. When the guys walk into his hidden, heavily wooded overgrown property, they are surprised by his incredible collection.

<title>Storage Wars</title><sub-title>Viva La San Francisco</sub-title><desc>Storage unit auctions are the newest and biggest untapped source for hidden treasures, and opportunistic individuals bid on unclaimed properties hoping to strike gold. Welcome to Storage Wars. In this character driven treasure hunt, bidders range from twenty something's out for fun and adventure - willing to say or do anything to win - to husband and wife teams looking to make fast and large cash and all are prepared to create quite the drama in the process. It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode of Storage Wars, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight. This short glimpse is their only opportunity to evaluate whether or not they think the unit holds rags or riches. Then, the bidding begins. One of the most successful auctioneers in the country, not to mention the most outrageous, drives the action and with the cast of characters who are our regular bidders, it's an outcome not to be missed.</desc><date>2011</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>American Pickers</title><sub-title>Laurel And Hardy</sub-title><desc>Danielle has asked for a raise, but the guys delay a decision until they see how successful the next trip she sends them on is through Kentucky. First they visit a serious collector who, after a life-altering incident, is definitely in the mood to sell. They also stop in at the geodesic dome home of biker couple Tracey and Paul. They only have an hour to scour the massive collection but that's more than enough time for Mike and Frank to find their most unusual items. And they visit two spunky retirees who live in a former honky-tonk spot that's complete with a stage and a sprawling toy collection. Their eventual haul includes a KISS pinball machine, a vintage steam-powered corn popper and massive Laurel and Hardy costume heads. Finally, Frank and Mike interview Danielle to discuss her raise....and torture her a little more.</desc><date>2010</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.9.</episode-num><video><quality>HDTV</quality></video><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

They call the first day Hell Day, and appropriately so. The immediate barrage of insults and gruelling demands delivers a brutal dose of what lies ahead. As with similar training programmes, the new recruits endure very hard times, but this is not a typical boot camp. Rather than patriotic men and women ready to serve their country, they are underage, violent felons who are anything but eager to be here. From first-time convicts to young, street-savvy veterans, this group walks the thin line between delinquency and prison.</desc><category>Documentary</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.3.</episode-num><video><quality>HDTV</quality></video><rating><value>MA</value></rating>

Shrimping has been part of the Gulf since the 17th century when fisherman used vertical nets up to 600 feet in diameter to scoop up the delicacy. With the invention of the flat bottom "otter trawl"along with motorised engines, the territory and depth of shrimping expanded.

It's wall-to-wall clutter and boxes that haven't been opened in 50 years. Mike dives right in but Frank seems to have lost his picking mojo. Then they head over to Wisconsin where Larry's built an entire town with vintage buildings including a blacksmith, post office, printing shop, gas station, jail, saloon, bank, fire department, and more. And finally, the only thing better than Ted's quirky small town gas station is his one-of-a-kind home. Built around his huge collection, it's a picking theme park where everything is for sale. Everything is looking good until Frank senses engine trouble with the van while Mike ignores the signs and ends up on his hands and knees.</desc><date>2010</date><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.11.</episode-num><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Code of Silence</title><desc>In the late 1990s, New England is hit by a crime wave, netting millions for a gang of sophisticated thieves. A rash of armoured car and bank robberies turn deadly as the gang gets sloppy, and guards must pay the price with their lives. Investigators attempt to blend in to a crime-ridden Boston community for information and names of anyone associated with the crime wave, but nobody in the tight nit area will cooperate with authorities. Catching a break, federal agents witness members of the gang as they attempt to rob another bank, and arrest them before more violence can occur. With the leader of the gang behind bars, community members feel safer cooperating with authorities to bring the remaining members of the "Boston Bandits" to justice.</desc><date>2003</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Drama Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

While Jo strikes up a new friendship with an old flame (Catherine Keener), 16-year-old Kelly (Willa Holland) explores the underbelly of this mysterious new world, and the younger Mary (Perla Haney-Jardine) has ghostly visions of her mother wandering the labyrinth-like streets.</desc><credits><director>Michael Winterbottom</director><actor>Colin Firth</actor><actor>Catherine Keener</actor><actor>Willa Holland</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Drama</category><category>Movie</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Midsomer Murders</title><sub-title>Fit For Murder</sub-title><desc>DCI Tom Barnaby bids an emotional farewell to Midsomer Murders as he tackles his last case of murder and mayhem in the picturesque but deadly villages. Barnaby hands in his police badge after over 80 episodes and 14 years in the starring role. Fit for Murder is also the final episode for Jane Wymark, who has played Barnaby's long-suffering wife Joyce since the series began in 1997, and Laura Howard, who has co-starred regularly as his daughter Cully. Midsomer's new detective DCI John Barnaby also makes an appearance. DCI John Barnaby, a cousin of Tom Barnaby, moves to Midsomer to team up with DI Ben Jones, played by established Midsomer Murders star Jason Hughes. In Fit For Murder, Barnaby reluctantly accompanies Joyce on a spa weekend to upmarket Swavely Manor. But as he attempts to de-stress amid the New Age therapies, a woman is found dead in the floatation chamber. Abandoning the treatments to investigate, Barnaby uncovers a feud between neighbours, money wrangles and the mystery of a half-written novel. But, despite the distractions of the case, Barnaby has a birthday approaching and a decision to make. His personal worries are never far from the surface.</desc><credits><actor>John Nettles</actor><actor>Daniel Casey</actor><actor>Jane Wymark</actor><actor>Laura Howard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Crime Drama</category><category>Mystery and Suspense</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Mystery and Thriller</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">12.7.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>Where's My Rotator?</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again. Fast.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Hide And Seek</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.21.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Louis Theroux</title><sub-title>Law &amp; Disorder In Johannesburg</sub-title><desc>Despairing of the capability of the police and the courts to protect them, many have turned to an industry of private security offering protection for a price. Are the sometimes brutal methods of these private police really a solution, or just another part of the problem? The first stop for Louis is a meeting with William Mayangoni, the local co-ordinator for a security firm known as Mapogo. Based on the outskirts of Diepsloot, one of the squatter camps that rings Johannesburg, William investigates thefts for his mainly white clients. When he catches a suspect, he gives them "medicine": the alleged offender is beaten with a leather whip known as a sjambok. Although his clients seem to support what they see as "an African solution to an African problem", William's methods alienate the people of Diepsloot. Finally, their patience snaps, and William has to call out the real police in order to protect himself from the vicious threat of the mob. In the centre of Johannesburg, a security company called Bad Boyz works in an area called Hillbrow, notorious for its high crime rate. Louis meets company director Hendrik De Klerk, who explains that much of their activity involves reclaiming and securing buildings that have been taken over - or hijacked - by criminal gangs who illegally take rent from tenants. Louis watches dramatic evictions unfold, in which the police and security companies aren't afraid to use force to kick out the protesting residents, and progress often involves turfing families out onto the streets. While on patrol, Bad Boyz introduce Louis to an unseen Johannesburg underworld. Here, he meets the gang boss known only as "The Chairman" and is escorted into a hijacked skyscraper to meet residents who have lived for years without electricity or water. As he watches Bad Boyz protect their buildings and tenants, Louis begins to wonder about their readiness to use violence, and witnesses the compromises that are made to keep order in a violent city.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>MA</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Koko's New Look</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Babysitter Brewster</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Lights Camera Action Chugger</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen.

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>What Loud Music, Tombliboos!</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.22.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Highway Thru Hell</title><sub-title>It's Stormy Everywhere</sub-title><desc>In the rugged mountains of British Columbia in Canada, there's a highway like no other. An unforgiving, white-knuckle ride that thousands of truckers must run every day. Keeping the Coquihalla Highway open takes an army of men and machines and the last line of defense is the fleet of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue. Jamie's team is willing to tackle any disaster the mountain throws at them. They have been entrusted to keep some of the most economically important and inhospitable roads in Canada open and safe during the winter season. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying clear, but the extreme mountain roads are fraught with steep, icy terrain where Mother Nature reigns supreme. During winter storms truckers crash and close the road every twelve hours on average and when they do, the call goes out to the team of heavy rescue tow truck drivers who are on call 24/7. Even the toughest men in the towing business are pushed to breaking point; they have witnessed some horrific scenes. The drivers must brave the extreme temperatures and seemingly impossible conditions to remove often dangerous cargo, clean up the carnage and get the truck traffic rolling again.

<title>Waybuloo</title><desc>Discover that 'everything is better together' in Waybuloo. Waybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara : a world inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, Waybuloo focuses on children's feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony : all in search of 'Waybuloo'. Piplings are joyful and gentle creatures who personify positive emotion through the natural ability to float when they're happy. They have a childlike innocence and sense of wonder, making them inquisitive, impulsive and funny. Naturally selfless, thoughtful and sweet-natured, they take care in their relationships with each other and the world.  In each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo. Episode One: De Li stands on a box to reach some plumatoes on a tree. Having picked the fruit, she takes the box to her pod. But when she gets back from Yogo, the box has gone! It turns out that each Pipling is 'borrowing' the box for his or her own needs. Episode Two: Showtime : Saturday December 05 at 11:00am Lau Lau is planning a big show. She gathers everyone at Yo Jojo's performance area and does her dance. The others are so impressed, they join in! But their moves aren't right : and worse : they're taking the limelight away from Lau Lau</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Where Can Igglepiggle Have A Rest?</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.23.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Chuggington</title><sub-title>Hodge Sails Away</sub-title><desc>Chuggington follows the adventures of three young trainee trains, Wilson, Brewster and Koko as they learn to ride the rails. Their 'training time' provides the storylines and echoes the experience of every pre-school age child as they too take their first steps into the world. The community refers to the trains as 'chuggers'. The trains talk, think for themselves and don't need drivers. This series features chuggers from all around the world, whether diesel, electric, steam, or high-speed and they all live and work in Chuggington. Ep 1 - Can't Catch Koko When Harrison breaks down, Koko volunteers to replace him on the night shift, determined to make the fastest run ever. But Vee insists that Wilson and Brewster go too, despite Koko's protests that Brewster will slow them down. Koko races off, teasing Brewster about being a 'slowcoach.' Suddenly Koko shudders and slows down to a stop and the others are nowhere to be seen. Chuggington will be repeated on ABC2 - Thursday, February 19 at 12:45pm</desc><date>0</date><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.5.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Satellite Boy</title><desc>Catriona McKenzie's directorial feature debut is a heartfelt, moving and uplifting story about a young boy's journey to save his home and ultimately himself. This film follows Pete, a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy who lives with his elderly grandfather, Old Jagamarra. Home is the abandoned outdoor cinema in the outback town of Wyndham. When it is threatened with demolition, Pete sees his world in jeopardy and sets off for the city. He is joined by his friend Kalmain, who has his own reasons for leaving town. Together the boys travel through epic and stunning Kimberley country and when they get lost in the bush, Pete has to remember some of the old Aboriginal bush skills his grandfather taught him for them to survive. Fable-like in its storytelling, it shows a world torn between old and new, tradition and progress, nature and technology. Celebrating the importance of family, true friendship and cultural and spiritual identity, this film is captivating and affecting.</desc><credits><director>Catriona Mckenzie</director><actor>David Gulpilil</actor><actor>Cameron Wallaby</actor></credits><date>2012</date><category>Drama</category><category>Movie</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 1</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition.

Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers.

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 4</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><sub-title>series 1, episode 5</sub-title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life. Episode two: Thursday, March 1 at 7.30am This episode introduces Mario and his faithful assistant Luigi into the world outside of their computer game; two naughty girl guides try to earn their 'Being Helpful' badges, the first instalment of 'Viking High', Voldemort tries to win a board game, resident safety girl Maive Blairs lays out the rules, and Rex the dinosaur takes on his bullies in a running race.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" />

<title>You're Skitting Me</title><desc>Building on the traditions of The Late Show and Fast Forward, You're Skitting Me is a new edgy 13 x 25" Australian sketch comedy series starring six new Australian teen actors who perform sketches about zombies, cavemen, naughty girl guides and parodies of Twilight and talent shows. Cosmo, Rowan, Hayden, Jake, Molly and Mia are fresh, funny, unpredictable and different and give the series its innovative, edgy appeal. During the series, the ABC3 audience is introduced to characters such as Tattiana the Sailor Girl, Voldemort, Internet Speak Girl, Mario and Luigi, Cavemen, Vikings, Naughty Girl Guides, Bear Cub, the Hipsters, Uncle Vijay, Inappropriate Joe, the Australia's Next Big Talent judges and the accident prone Helmet Boy. The series also features regular animated segments with characters such as Vomit Boy and his faithful assistant Kayne, Barry and Chuck the tomatoes, Ned the panda, and Rex the dinosaur. You're Skitting Me was written by a combination of some of Australia's most experienced comedy writers including Mark O'Toole and Ray Matsen along with some of the newest rising-star writers and a cast who were encouraged to develop their writing skills with a mentor program designed to find the next generation of comic writers. Episode one: Wednesday, February 29 at 7.30am The first episode of You're Skitting Me features skits on Twilight and Australia's Next Big Talent competition. Uncle Vijay is introduced and provides commentary on the latest television shows and also takes a look at cavemen times to see what new and amazing ideas are being discussed. Jacob the child superstar tries to make a comeback; two BFF's go through some good and bad times; the kids of Jolimont High Witness News take a look at detention; Superhero Vomit Boy takes on his latest adventure and Barry and Chuck, the tomatoes, argue over the small things in life.

<title>Outnumbered</title><desc>Experience the daily rollercoaster ride of family life in the new comedy series Outnumbered. The series provides an honest portrayal of the well meaning, parental incompetence that happens in most homes. Mum (Claire Skinner) and Dad (Hugh Dennis) attempt to raise their three inquisitive and imaginative kids with minimum emotional damage for all concerned. The eldest child is Jake (Tyger Drew-Honey), a thoughtful eleven-year-old whose parents are a perpetual embarrassment to him. Then there's Ben (Daniel Roche), a terrifyingly exuberant eight-year-old who, when his sister locks herself in the bathroom, advises his exasperated Dad to lob beavers in through the window so that they can eat the door. Finally, there's Karen (Ramona Marquez), a five-year-old girl with the looks of an angel and the mind of a barrister, who can demoralise adults at will with her relentless interrogations.</desc><credits><actor>Claire Skinner</actor><actor>Hugh Dennis</actor></credits><category>Comedy</category><category>Situation</category><category>Comedies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Drillbit Taylor</title><desc>Steven Brill (Without a Paddle) directs Owen Wilson in this comedy from the producers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and the writers of Superbad, where three young students; Ryan (Troy Gentile), Wade (Nate Hartley) and Emmit (David Dorfman), attend their first day at high school. All is well until they meet up with Filkins (Alex Frost), a school bully who channels Hannibal Lecter. They come up with the idea of getting some protection from this maniac by placing an ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine; enter Drillbit Taylor (Wilson), not the best but definitely the cheapest of the mercenaries, hit men and bodyguards who respond. Drillbit is steely, dangerous and skilled in covert black-ops and exotic martial arts; he's also a complete fraud. Taylor enrols them in physical and mental training, steeling them, and possibly himself, for the ultimate clash against the forces of evil.</desc><credits><director>Steven Brill</director><actor>Owen Wilson</actor><actor>David Dorfman</actor><actor>David Koechner</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Movie</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Spy Kids 4: All The Time In The World</title><desc>Jessica Alba and Jeremy Piven star in this fourth installment in the Spy Kids franchise, about a former spy who is brought back to work after marrying and having a baby and tries to hide her work from her new stepkids, but when they find out, they seize the opportunity to help with the mission. Putting away her spy career after the birth of her new baby, Marissa (Jessica Alba) commits to life with her daughter and her stepchildren, Rebecca and Cecil (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook), and her husband, journalist Wilbur Wilson (Joel McHale), who spends his life tracking down and exposing spies. Domestic life is short-lived, however, as Marissa is pressed back into action by the appearance of master-villian The Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven), and she is forced to reveal her true identity to the children, including the fact that the family dog, Argonaut (voice of Ricky Gervais) is a robot. Rebecca and Cecil are very impressed, but when they are spirited to OSS spy headquarters after an attempted break-in at their house, they jump at the chance to follow in both Marissa's and the original Spy Kids' (Darryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) footsteps and become Spy Kids themselves.</desc><credits><director>Robert Rodriguez</director><actor>Jessica Alba</actor><actor>Jeremy Piven</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Action</category><category>Movie</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movies</category><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>4/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Defining Moments</title><sub-title>Earth Family</sub-title><desc>Earth Family is a story about two women, a handful of Aboriginal Elders and a group of migrant youth. Its a story about how Acceptance and Respect played a vital role in healing the human Spirit. When singer songwriter Kerrianne Cox and Theatre Director / writer Cymbeline Buhler met they devised a project that would be both an empowering tool and a Life changing experience for all involved. Cymbeline runs the Western Edge Youth group in Melbourne. The young people she works with come from migrant families who have face their own issues. Many who come from war torn poverty stricken Countries and have never been outside of Victoria. Western Edge uses Arts as a way of dealing with their trauma. The plan was to take this Melbourne based youth group to the remote Beagle Bay in Kimberley's to meet with Community Elders. From listening to the Elders stories they would learn part of their history then under the Elders guidance produce a theatre play. They young people themselves would perform the play which tells of the impact of colonization on the Beagle Bay Community. The youth would perform the play twice, once in the small Beagle Bay Community and again in Broome to the general public. This documentary is a powerful example of how People from different cultural backgrounds and different generations can come together and connect in meaningful way to create change both in the wider Community and within themselves.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Defining Moments</title><sub-title>Earth Family</sub-title><desc>Earth Family is a story about two women, a handful of Aboriginal Elders and a group of migrant youth. Its a story about how Acceptance and Respect played a vital role in healing the human Spirit. When singer songwriter Kerrianne Cox and Theatre Director / writer Cymbeline Buhler met they devised a project that would be both an empowering tool and a Life changing experience for all involved. Cymbeline runs the Western Edge Youth group in Melbourne. The young people she works with come from migrant families who have face their own issues. Many who come from war torn poverty stricken Countries and have never been outside of Victoria. Western Edge uses Arts as a way of dealing with their trauma. The plan was to take this Melbourne based youth group to the remote Beagle Bay in Kimberley's to meet with Community Elders. From listening to the Elders stories they would learn part of their history then under the Elders guidance produce a theatre play. They young people themselves would perform the play which tells of the impact of colonization on the Beagle Bay Community. The youth would perform the play twice, once in the small Beagle Bay Community and again in Broome to the general public. This documentary is a powerful example of how People from different cultural backgrounds and different generations can come together and connect in meaningful way to create change both in the wider Community and within themselves.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Message Stick</title><sub-title>Benny Walker</sub-title><desc>Musician Benny Walker's back-drop is the festival that his grandfather helped establish in his home town of Echuca. Offering a seamless blend of soul, blues, reggae and folk, singer-songwriter Benny Walker is without doubt one of Australia's most promising rising stars and 2012 is shaping up to be a big year for this young Yorta-Yorta man. A lot of interest has been building around Benny Walker since the release of his self-titled debut album in 2008. Now his highly anticipated album 'Summer Sun' is shaping up to be a huge success for him. With regular shows around regional Victoria and an East Coast tour planned to promote his new album, this singer-songwriter barely has time to himself these days and he wouldn't have it any other way. Born and bred in the Victorian town of Echuca, Benny's main passion has always been music. His father and both grandfathers all played in bands and have been a steady form of support and big influence throughout Benny's career. Like his brother Benny has grown to be a strong Indigenous role model. He spends time between Echuca and Melbourne but uses his free time giving talks to young Aboriginal people at the YMCA and works with the Richmond Football Club as a mentor. Recently Benny has been invited to perform at some of Australia's finest music festivals and his thoughtful, sunny rhythms combined with his smooth soulful voice have been described by many as 'simply amazing'. But first he returns to Echuca to perform at the Riverboat Festival to continue a family tradition which now spans three generations.</desc><category>Social Issues</category><category>Current Affairs</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Jila</title><sub-title>Painted Waters Of The Great Sandy</sub-title><desc>The Ngurrara people know their desert country - it's where they grew up. But to claim their native title they need to show their knowledge and ownership of the land in a way that makes sense to them and the visiting Native Title Tribunal. They decide to paint their country - on a massive scale. Seventy artists set to work on a specially made canvas measuring eight by ten metres. The richness, complexity and energy of desert life are intertwined with this creative process and the story of the Ngurrara Native Title claim itself. The film culminates in the painting's first journey to Canberra. It goes on display while adults and children sing and dance around it in celebration of their country and in anticipation of claiming it back.</desc><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Message Stick</title><sub-title>The Urab Dancers</sub-title><desc>The Urab Dancers are serving as a beacon for the young Porumagul people of the Torres Strait who believe that language and dance have something to offer them, and indeed that they have something to offer in return. They have shared their cultural performances and stories with wider audiences and this year plan to undertake a tour to several destinations on mainland Australia. What's in store for a group of young people who are now realising their cultural past holds the key to their very modern future? The Torres Strait is home to the Porumagul people of the Kulkulgal nation. This community is one of the smallest in the Torres Strait, and is keenly aware of the problems facing many Indigenous communities in Australia in their loss of cultural identity and tradition. In the past, Elders have been the cornerstone in maintaining the teaching and practice of traditional and cultural knowledge; but recently an unexpected social shift has occurred in some communities whereby the young people have become the proactive element within those roles.</desc><category>Social Issues</category><category>Current Affairs</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Last Chance Harvey</title><desc>Oscar-winners Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson star in this hopeful romance that celebrates new beginnings - at any age. New Yorker Harvey Shine (Hoffman) puts his dead-end job as a jingle writer in jeopardy to attend his daughter's (Liane Balaban) wedding in London. Yet on arrival, his daughter tells him she's asked her stepfather (James Brolin) to walk her down the aisle. Lonely Kate (Thompson), a 40-something woman whose life is limited to work, the occasional humiliating blind date and endless phone calls from her smothering mother, meets Harvey at the airport bar and they soon find themselves happily thrust into an unexpected romance. The growing connection between the pair inspires both as they begin to transform one another's lives and discover that it's never too late for love.</desc><credits><director>Joel Hopkins</director><actor>Dustin Hoffman</actor><actor>Emma Thompson</actor><actor>Liane Balaban</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Drama</category><category>Movie</category><category>Drama Group</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

Alfred's bones have been moved so many times over the centuries that many people concluded that they were lost forever. Following a trail that goes back over a thousand years, the team wants to unravel the mystery of Alfred's remains. Travelling from Winchester to Rome, Neil also tells the extraordinary story of Alfred's life: in the 9th century, he became one of England's most important kings by fighting off the Vikings, uniting the Anglo-Saxon people and launching a cultural renaissance. With the discovery of some unexpected new evidence, The Search for Alfred the Great reveals the extraordinary outcome of an important investigation.

<title>The Ark Of The Covenant</title><desc>The most famous lost treasure of them all is a wooden box, covered in gold, topped with two winged figures. According to the Bible, the Ark of the Covenant was made at Gods command, some three thousand years ago, by the Israelites, as they wandered through the desert. It was to hold the stone tablets on which the ten commandments were written, and it was also to mark the Israelites special status as Gods chosen people; and his promise - to them - his covenant - that they would have a land of their own. This documentary sets out to discover the truth behind this story, whether the ark really exists at all, and if so, its whereabouts.

<title>The Fence</title><desc>In 2006, the United States government decided to build a fence along its Mexican border. After three years, 350 engineers, thousands of construction workers, tens of thousands of tons of metal, and billions of dollars, the question is: Was it all worth it? Award-winning filmmaker Rory Kennedy investigates the impact of the $3 billion project, revealing how the fence's stated goals, containing illegal immigration, cracking down on drug trafficking, and protecting America from terrorists, have given way to unforeseen, even absurd, consequences.</desc><credits><director>Rory Kennedy</director><actor>Daryl Reed</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>4/10</value></star-rating>

<title>The Ark Of The Covenant</title><desc>The most famous lost treasure of them all is a wooden box, covered in gold, topped with two winged figures. According to the Bible, the Ark of the Covenant was made at Gods command, some three thousand years ago, by the Israelites, as they wandered through the desert. It was to hold the stone tablets on which the ten commandments were written, and it was also to mark the Israelites special status as Gods chosen people; and his promise - to them - his covenant - that they would have a land of their own. This documentary sets out to discover the truth behind this story, whether the ark really exists at all, and if so, its whereabouts.

<title>The Island With Bear Grylls</title><desc>Generations of men have wondered if they could survive on a desert island. This new six-part series makes this challenge a reality for 13 ordinary British men. Bear Grylls sets up the ultimate survival experiment to discover if the average modern man is tough and resourceful enough to survive on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island for a month. These 13 men are left completely alone, with only the clothes they stand up in and some basic tools, filming the entire experience themselves with no camera crew. The island may look like paradise, but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. This is their story, told by them in a groundbreaking, raw and exhilarating exploration of survival.
